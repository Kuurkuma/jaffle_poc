    "1. Unified Ads Performance Dashboard (Facebook & Google)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "A marketing company using direct connectors ( Supermetrics) for Facebook and Google Ads faced expensive licensing fees and slow dashboards.\n",
    "They lacked a centralized database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the slow connectors with a dlt-based ELT pipeline that ingests raw data directly into BigQuery. This aimed to unify ad spend metrics into a single, high-performance SQL view for fast and accurate reporting in Looker Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limits**\n",
    "\n",
    "No data people in the team to follow up or create the SQL requests necessary for the dashboard. Company not data mature to consider the need of a data pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "A solo data analyst needed to centralize data from five distinct APIs into Snowflake but faced budget constraints that ruled out managed SaaS solutions like Airbyte Cloud. His attempt to self-host Airbyte on Kubernetes (GKE) proved operationally overwhelming and too complex for a one-person team to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to replace heavy infrastructure with a lightweight dlt-based pipeline that runs on simple CLoud Function. This approach aimed to bypass the complexity of managing a self-hosted platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limits**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data Analyst were not very comfortable to manage a python ingestion pipeline by himself.\n"

    "    - SLAs: Is the data needed in real-time (streaming), hourly, or daily?\n",

    "## Phase 2: Technical Execution\n",

    "        - Scalable: Astro or Dagster (not a big fan of Cloud composer)\n",

    "3. Source Reliability\n",
    "    - Implement unit test for data type checking and null-value. It could be also done in SQL via dbt unit tests\n",

    "    - Rate limiting: Implement backoff strategies to respect API quotas.\n",

    "4. Documentation & Observability\n",
    "    - Lineage: Document the data transformation flow.\n",
    "    - Alerting: Set up notifications (Slack/email) for failures.\n",
